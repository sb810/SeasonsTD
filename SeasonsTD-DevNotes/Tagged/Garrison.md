While garrisoned, the [[Main Character]] takes control of [[Towers]], and can alter their functions.

## Camera and targeting
In Garrison, the player completely disappears, and becomes totally immune. The cursor becomes a crosshair, and allows targeting of specific enemies. The camera's range is now limited to the tower's range plus a small bonus, and moving the cursor around the screen allows seeing further (that increase is also limited).

## Garrison menu
Garrison shows a special menu, through which the player may
- a) upgrade the current tower - for a cost. 
- b) delete the current tower, which provides a lesser return on [[Resources]].
- c) access the tower's [[Inventory]].
- d) access the tower's special ability, if available.
- e) exit garrison.
